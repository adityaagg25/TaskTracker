# TaskTracker
A feature-rich and responsive task management web app built with React.js, designed to help users stay organized and productive. Whether you're a student juggling assignments or a professional managing tasks, this app provides a clean and intuitive interface to stay on top of your to-do list.
## 📖 Description
TaskTracker is a personal productivity tool with features that allow users to create and manage tasks, categorize them, assign priorities, visualize progress, and log in (via localStorage). It seeks to make for the user a smooth experience with minimal setup and no backend required. Interactive UI elements guide users throughout their task adventure supporting light/dark themes and responsive layouts.

Each UI feature is encapsulated by well-structured reusable components because the project carefully reflects component-based architecture. The task data can persist locally and can ensure tasks are not lost on refresh. Overdue alerts as well as tag indicators allow users to navigate their workload effortlessly. For ease of navigation, color-coded task status also contributes a lot.
